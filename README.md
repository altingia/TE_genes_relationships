# TE_genes_relationships
perl scripts used to categorizing the relative locations between transposable elements and the adjacent genes 
Transposable elements were recognised to be hidden regulators in diverse growth and development transitions or
in response to abotic or abotic stresses.For the long term, the birth and death of transposable elements contribted
important source of genetic variations and have played great role in the genomic evolution dynamic. Locations were
considered to the first rule of plant tranposable element silencing (Meredith J. Sigman and Keith Slotkin R, 2016, 
The Plant Cell.Vol 28: 304-311). As the first step, these scripts were used to cateogorize the relative locations
between transposable elements and the adjacent genes based on the encoding genes and transposable element annotation
files. Given a transposable element copy, the nearest gene was dertmined among the catogories: I. embedded. II. 
5'-overlap (TE relative Gene).III. 3'-overlap; IV.5'-upstream; V. 3'-upstream;The relative distance d =0 (scenario I),
followed by overlap length (II, III), the form three scenarios do not always occur as the two latter.
